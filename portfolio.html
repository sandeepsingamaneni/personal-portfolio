          <p class="paragraph">
            Hello! This is Sandeep. I'm currently pursuing my Master's in CS at
            Portland State University. I have previously worked in banking
            industry and I aspire to be a Software Engineer after the completion
            of my studies. Currently I am learning Python along with Algorithms
            and Data Structures. I used Python for ETL and created a data base
            application which consists of World Transit Systems data. I had used
            Python as my primary language for the course work in AI and ML. I
            wish to use my problem solving and logical thinking skills along
            with my communication skills gained from my work experience to
            design and develop computer software. In my free time, I would like
            to travel and explore new places.

                Transit Systems Of World database consists of different datasets

                database contains information about transportation line data
                from a number of cities around the world including London,
                Berlin, Mexico City, Barcelona, Washington D.C., and others
                covering many thousands of kilometers of lines including
                corresponding cities and systems.It also includes station names
                and tracks for those cities.

                In this project, On Tuberculosis data, we offer a machine
                learning technique to compare the performance of K Nearest
                Neighbors and an ensemble of classifiers. Real data was used to
                train the categorization models. We have used Local KNN,
                Weighted KNN and Gradient Boosting to predict the disease in
                patients and we have compared their accuracies and found the
                best for our problem. The classifiers' prediction accuracy was
                assessed using k-fold Cross Validation, and the results were
                compared to determine the best prediction accuracy.

                This project presents the final high-fidelity interface
                prototype for our mobile social media aggregator app and
                discusses the justification of design decisions based on our
                initial research, design principles, analytical and empirical
                evaluations for the prototype. This was done in order to address
                usability problems with modern social media platforms and
                improve the experience for users of multiple social media
                platforms.
